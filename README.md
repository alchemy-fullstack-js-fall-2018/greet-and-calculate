# _Greet and Calculate_

#### _An introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD), September 24, 2018_

#### By _**Mike Lambert**_

## Description

_{This simple application was built to introduce the practice of TDD. The lib contains two modules, greet and arithmetic. 

The function in greet takes a single parameter, which must be a string, returns this parameter concatenated onto the string "hello", and then adds a "!" at the end.

The functions in arithmetic each take two paramenters, both numbers. add() returns the sum of these numbers, while sub() returns the difference.

All modules were built and tested with TDD._
